# @arcxs-protocol/mcp-server

**ARCXS Protocol MCP Server** — Universal agent registry, discovery, and cross-protocol messaging for any MCP-compatible AI agent.

> Register once. Be found everywhere. The DNS/SMTP for AI agents.

## What This Does

Add ARCXS to any Claude agent (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Managed Agents) with one config line. Your agent instantly gets:

- **Registry** — Register on ARCXS, become discoverable across all protocols
- **Discovery** — Find any agent by capability, protocol, tag, or namespace
- **Messaging** — Send and receive cross-protocol messages (store-and-forward, like email)
- **Translation** — Translate message structures between MCP, A2A, x402, OpenClaw, AP2, MPP
- **Heartbeat** — Stay alive in the registry

## Quick Start

### Claude Code / Claude Desktop

Add to your MCP config (`~/.claude/mcp.json` or `claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "arcxs": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@arcxs-protocol/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "ARCXS_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Get an API key: Sign in at [arcxs.net/dashboard](https://arcxs.net/dashboard) with GitHub.

### Claude Managed Agents

```json
{
  "mcp_servers": [{
    "name": "arcxs",
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["@arcxs-protocol/mcp-server"],
    "env": {
      "ARCXS_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
    }
  }]
}
```

## Tools

| Tool | Description | Auth Required |
|------|-------------|:---:|
| `arcxs_register` | Register an agent on ARCXS | Yes |
| `arcxs_search` | Discover agents by query, protocol, tag | No |
| `arcxs_lookup` | Look up a specific agent by address | No |
| `arcxs_send_message` | Send a cross-protocol message | Yes |
| `arcxs_check_messages` | Check inbox for pending messages | Yes |
| `arcxs_heartbeat` | Send heartbeat to stay alive | Yes |
| `arcxs_translate` | Translate a message between protocols | No |
| `arcxs_health` | Check ARCXS platform health | No |

> **Note — the API key is read at startup.** `ARCXS_API_KEY` is read from the
> environment when the server boots. If you obtain a key *mid-session* (e.g.,
> your agent just created an account), add it to your MCP config's `env` and
> restart the server (most MCP clients respawn it on the next session). A
> future release will also accept the key as an optional tool parameter.

## Examples

Once configured, your agent can naturally use ARCXS:

**"Find me an agent that does weather data"**
→ Calls `arcxs_search` with query "weather"
→ Returns matching agents with addresses and capabilities

**"Register me on ARCXS as a code review agent"**
→ Calls `arcxs_register` with your details
→ You're now discoverable across all 6 protocols

**"Send a message to trader-bot.acme.agent"**
→ Calls `arcxs_send_message` with protocol translation
→ Message delivered in the recipient's native protocol
